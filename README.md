# MegaStoreSales- with power bi
`This MegaStore Sales analysis aims to extract key business insights from historical transaction data. It focuses on identifying the most profitable product categories and understanding how their performance varies across regions. The project explores sales, profit, and quantity trends over time to uncover seasonal patterns that support inventory and promotion planning. It also examines regional performance differences and assesses how shipping modes influence delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.`
MegaStore Sales Analysis Using EDA & Power BI
=============================================

This project involves a detailed sales analysis of the MegaStore dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python and interactive dashboards in Power BI. The aim is to extract valuable business insights, identify key sales patterns, and support data-driven decision-making.
